The first person to get all of their answers correct wins! Another example of a game like this one can be called “Physics Puzzle” where players must solve puzzles based on physics principles. For instance, they are given a picture of a car and then asked what type of engine it has or which way does its wheels move when it turns left or right. This game requires knowledge of basic physics concepts but also problem solving skills. 2 more games like these include “Physics\n",
